# Dang Compiler

Dang is an experimental language to see how useful can be removing parenthesis and transform grammar to a form of sentence-like (statements).

It is based on the [Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) book by Thorsten Ball which I rewrote in C using my own `DCommon` library and with some modifications in approaches.
