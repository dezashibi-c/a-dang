# Dang Compiler

The idea behind `dang` is to implement a simple programming language which:

- Everything is statement
- ...

## Structure

- `cmake` any utility and re-usable files for your cmakes goes here.
- `extern` folder is where you put your external dependencies, as an example I have used `clove-unit` library for unit testing.
- `include` is where you put your exported header files.
- `src` is where your `.c` files must be placed.
- `tests` are written using `clove-unit` framework which is a lightweight and single header library.

**ðŸ‘‰ NOTE:** You can refer to [here](https://github.com/fdefelici/clove-unit) for more information about `clove-unit`.

**ðŸ‘‰ NOTE:** There is also `.clang-format` available for you to use.

**ðŸ‘‰ NOTE:** All the build artifacts will be placed in `out` folder, all the build artifacts for tests will be placed in `out_tests` folder.
